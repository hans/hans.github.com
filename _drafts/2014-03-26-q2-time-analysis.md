I'm emerging from my blogging hiatus to gush more about timeboxing. This time
around I'm armed with *an entire quarter's worth* of timebox data --- to be
precise, that's **1,477 boxes** or **1,120 hours** tracked in total.

## Tracking methodology

I've only made small tweaks in my tracking strategy since [last quarter][1].
These changes are effects of my work to refine my first stab at timeboxing as I
described in [my winter 2014 goals post][2]. I've become better at allocating
realistically sized boxes, especially for tasks that I engage in often. As a
result, I find it easier to adhere to the schedules that I set out for myself.

## Analysis

I used the same export and processing routine as last quarter, taking advantage
of [a small Python script][3] to convert my calendar export into a more
analysis-friendly CSV format. I began by manually categorizing each timebox into
one of the several categories I established [last quarter][4]. A naive analysis
of this annotated data showed that I needed new categories!

### Category overhaul

As I'll discuss later, it was evident from the start that the composition of a
typical day in the winter quarter changed drastically from the fall quarter
standard. Furthermore, the tasks which concerned me in the winter quarter didn't
fit well into the taxonomy I set out in the previous quarter. I decided to
extend my categorization system to include the following options:

- **Career:** interviews, career fairs, resume work, networking, tech talks,
  etc.
- **Class:** Stanford lectures, seminars, discussion sections
- **Health:** exercise, health tracking
- **Meals:** all events centered around food (both social and non-social)
- **Extra:** miscellaneous events whose value is somewhere around neutral
  (non-career email, web browsing, shopping, etc.)
- **Extra+:** miscellaneous events whose value is unambiguously high (writing,
  extracurricular study, targeted reading, academic planning, Anki, etc.)
- **Extra-:** miscellaneous events (perhaps necessary) whose value is
  unambiguously low (laundry, travel, printing, fetching mail, etc.)
- **Meetings:** non-career-related meetings
- **School extras:** activities, club meetings
- **Schoolwork** (abbreviated "SW"): all schoolwork not done in class (both
  consumption, e.g., reading and watching lectures; and production, e.g., code
  projects, working on problem sets)
- **Social:** spending time with friends, Skyping, etc.
- **Work:** paid career-related work

Specifically, I split the former monolithic "Extra" category into three separate
entries, in order to better assess my overall time usage. This was necessary
this quarter because a massive amount of my time (28.65%) fit under the "Extra"
umbrella (compare to 14.65% from the previous quarter). I also added a "Work"
category to contain the few weeks of work I put in over the winter break.

### Time distribution by time

Grouping by week, here is my proportional distribution of time among the
categories given:
