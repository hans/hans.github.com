## Academics

### Section leading

The Stanford computer science department offers a "section leading" position,
technically open to any enrolled Stanford student. Section leaders act as
teaching assistants for the high-enrollment 106A/B/X/L introductory classes.

Section leaders are enrolled in the class [CS198][sl1][^sl1]. Much of the basic necessary information is detailed on the [198 site][sl2].

#### Student perspectives

Most computer science students will affirm that the section leading position is
very competitve, and that those who earn the job are on the most part very
qualified.

Former section leaders list the following as the top benefits of becoming
involved (these cited in retrospect, after having graduated from the program):

- Meet other committed computer science students (accomplished enough to be
  accepted after a rigorous application process)
- Gain teaching experience and experience with the languages taught in the
  introductory classes
- Signal your worth to future potential employers

The most significant disadvantage: **a large time commitment.** The pay,
according to one former section leader, does not make up for the amount of time
and level of intense work required. About 15 hours per week of work is required.
This includes attending three 106A lectures per week, plus weekly section
leading workshops.
