# Challenges for theories of argument realization

> We follow Dowty (1991) and take as our primary criterion for developing a lexical semantic representation the ability to formulate a perspicuous theory of argument realization. Any semantic distinction that affects argumetn realization is relevant to the design of a lexical semantic representation, while any others are to be ignored (9–10).

First examples: claim that sound-production verbs have semantically distinct classes "internally produced" and "externally produced," which pattern syntactically:

1. ​
   1. The truck rumbled.
   2. *Peter rumbled the truck.
2. 
   1. The tea kettle whistled.
   2. *The boiling water whistled the tea kettle.
3. 
   1. The teacups clattered.
   2. I clattered the teacups as I loaded the dishwasher.
4. 
   1. The windows rattled.
   2. The storm rattled the windows.

[worried about indeterminacy / too many free parameters; easy to tell a just-so story — at least within a single language — about some aspect of meaning which successfully picks out the relevant syntactic classes]

> there is more than one way of semantically characterizing most verbs, and it is not always a priori obvious which characterization is appropriate for argument realization. Certainly, concepts with greater generality such as "change of state" or "activity" are prefereable in principle to more specific concepts such as "verb of bodily process" (13).

[WHY? From an acquisition perspective, more specific driving semantic aspects are more useful to a learner using syntax to bootstrap lexical semantics]

## The crossclassification of verbs and the status of verb classes

Closing argument claims that the constructionist and verb-class research program are well aligned:

> an important point of convergence ... : proponents of both approaches agree to a     large extet on what the elements of meaning are — be they lexical or extralexical — which determine the realization of arguments, and so the identification of these elements of meaning can be considered a real achievement of research into argument realization (18).

## Uniformity and variation in argument realization

> If the appropriate elements of meaning are chosen, verbs whose classification is clearcut with respect to these elements of meaning should have stable argument realization patterns [both within and across languages], while those whose classification is less clearcut are expected to show wider variation (21).

Should draw out multiple assumptions here:

1. the relevant "elements of meaning" are shared across languages;
2. the mapping between "elements of meaning" and argument structure is ideally stable across languages. (??? am I misunderstanding? this seems a very strong — and unnecessary — assumption)
3. "instability" / uncertainty in semantic class of verb => "instability" in argument realization. (why should this be the case? this is presupposing a very tight link between syntactic and semantic systems)

> Any theory of argument realiation taken together with a well-motivated theory of lexical semantic representation should allow researchers to predict which semantic classes of verbs will be stable and uniform in their argument realization options, in and across languages, and which will not (23).

[why? the syntax–semantics mapping can be a completely free parameter across languages, no? why assume that some semantic classes will always be realized in regular syntactic classes? Is there some underlying assumption of innateness here?]

## When subjects are not agents and objects are not patients

Interesting examples (#26) of nonagentive subjects. Also interesting, note that none of the following are acceptable in passive form!

1. This room sleeps five people. [subject is a location]
   1. *Five people are slept by this room.
   2. Five people (can) sleep in this room.
2. This edition of the textbook had added a new chapter. [subject is a location [?]]
   1. *A new chapter had been added by this edition of the textbook.
   2. A new chapter had been added in this edition of the textbook.
3. A dollar won't buy a cup of coffee anymore. [subject is a measure]
   1. *A cup of coffee can't be bought by a dollar anymore.
   2. ? A cup of coffee can't be bought with a dollar anymore.

# Semantic role lists

Basic idea: posit a small set of categories which allow us to capture grammatically relevant distinctions (i.e., allow us to predict how a verb's argument structure is realized from such semantic role assignments). For a particular verb, then, a semantic role acts as a grammatical equivalence class over its constituent legal members. (Such theories require us to develop a transformation between semantic role and syntactic structure, of course.)

> The current dominant approach to semantic roles takes them to be defined by recurring sets of lexical entailments ... imposed by verbs on their arguments. ... Every ver specifies certain entailments that hold if its arguments (e.g., *murder* entails that its subject acts volitionally) (38).
