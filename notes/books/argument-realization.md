# Challenges for theories of argument realization

> We follow Dowty (1991) and take as our primary criterion for developing a lexical semantic representation the ability to formulate a perspicuous theory of argument realization. Any semantic distinction that affects argumetn realization is relevant to the design of a lexical semantic representation, while any others are to be ignored (9–10).

First examples: claim that sound-production verbs have semantically distinct classes "internally produced" and "externally produced," which pattern syntactically:

1. ​
   1. The truck rumbled.
   2. *Peter rumbled the truck.
2.  
   1. The tea kettle whistled.
   2. *The boiling water whistled the tea kettle.
3.  
   1. The teacups clattered.
   2. I clattered the teacups as I loaded the dishwasher.
4.  
   1. The windows rattled.
   2. The storm rattled the windows.

[worried about indeterminacy / too many free parameters; easy to tell a just-so story — at least within a single language — about some aspect of meaning which successfully picks out the relevant syntactic classes]

> there is more than one way of semantically characterizing most verbs, and it is not always a priori obvious which characterization is appropriate for argument realization. Certainly, concepts with greater generality such as "change of state" or "activity" are prefereable in principle to more specific concepts such as "verb of bodily process" (13).

[WHY? From an acquisition perspective, more specific driving semantic aspects are more useful to a learner using syntax to bootstrap lexical semantics]
