# Typological patterns in the representation of event structure

motivation for lexicalization-talk:

- consider utterance "what pressure was exerted?"
- the meaning here is "what *degree of* pressure was exerted"
- contrast "what color was shown", where we're asking "what *type of* color was shown"
- three arguments for associating meaning with a surface form:
  - **lexicalization**: here some distinct "pressure," call it $\text{pressure}_2$, encodes the "degree-of" semantics (or maybe a distinct word "what" ?)
  - **deletion / zero-modification**: there is some deleted / elided "degree-of" morpheme here
  - **interpretation**: the "degree-of" interpretation comes from context/general knowledge and is not part of language
- this book takes the LEXICALIZATION perspective

## Lexicalization patterns

motion events are often expressed with a "co-event" (manner or cause of motion)

### The verb

this section: verb roots across languages (esp. motion verbs)

English motion verbs "conflate" motion event and the manner co-event ("The rock *slid* down the hill") or motion event and a cause co-event ("The napkin *blew* off the table")

Lexicalization read: a verb like *float* conflates two separate concepts: one of motion and one of situated / stative relationship

1. float_1 (motion AND manner): "The hovercraft floated into the hangar on a cushion of air"
2. float_2 (stative): "The hovercraft floated on a cushion of air"

other verbs don't get conflated like this:

1. \* lie_1 (motion AND manner): "The pen lay quickly down along the incline."
2. lie_2 (stative): "The pen lay on the plank."

[you can totally use transitive "lay" with motion+manner, though]

[Talmy doesn't want to assign any of the meaning here to the construction, contra Goldberg and friends. he takes the "lie" case to be an argument against this. Of course, it can be a little-bit-of-both â€” we have to explain why, for the verbs that *do* accept e.g. an "into" PP, why the meaning relation between core and the verb in that "into"-construction is so regular]

#### Getting serious: deep morphemes

- **deep morpheme**: concept which is fundamental and universal in the semantic organization of language.
  BE_LOC, MOVE, AGENT, WITH-THE-MANNER-OF
- **mid-level morpheme**: conceptual complex composing a deep morpheme with some other stuff, possibly language-specific.
