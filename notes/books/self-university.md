> Abraham Lincoln, the sixteenth president of the United States, was
> self-educated. He had little more than one year of formal schooling.
> Herbert Spencer, one of the most famous philosophers of the nineteenth
> century, remained an uneducated man until the age of forty, at which
> time he educated himself. Thomas A. Edison, technological genius and
> holder of over a thousand patents, had only three months of formal
> schooling. R. Buckminster Fuller, philosopher, engineer, architect,
> inventor, and poet, clearly one of the most original thinkers of the
> twentieth century, never completed his formal education.

> Aside from the process of socialization, the greatest lesson we
> learned was that of "conformity" We learned how to be instructed,
> where to stand, where to sit, what to think, and when to talk. We
> learned that the invitation to ask questions, though sincere by a few
> teachers, was not in the long term to be taken seriously. We learned
> to accept authority without question.

> Students learn quickly to distinguish between what the teacher says
> and what the teacher does. Teachers routinely ask if there are any
> questions, but the packaged curriculum doesn't allow time for
> questions. Even if it did, the student might fear appearing dumb by
> exposing his or her ignorance. Experience teaches the student that few
> teachers expect the invitation for questions to be taken seriously.
> There are teachers who sincerely make the offer (and indeed some
> attempt to establish a Socratic dialog), but they are in the minority.
> Moreover the reversal of a student's preconditioned behavioral
> response is not usually spontaneous. In other words, one positive
> experience will not stand up against ten bad ones.

> A major thesis of this book is that we should use the process of self
> education to see things as they "are" and as they "should" be, but, in
> light of the way we are formally educated in America, for me to be
> objective requires that I devote a disproportional amount of space to
> skepticism.

> In order to remain free, people have to be intellectually free from
> the influence of manipulation and knowledgeable enough about the
> nature of indoctrination to recognize it.

> And what is the effect of television on our imaginations and creative
> abilities? Do we lose creative ability by spending hour after hour
> watching what is in essence a product of someone else's imagination?

> After years of such stimulation, many people discover that television
> has become a crevice of escape. The viewer watches, and time passes;
> there is little reflection and little remembrance of the time that has
> passed. The experience is neither real, nor imaginary. It exists
> somewhere in between. In time, reruns are preferred over reflection
> and thought.

> I am not suggesting that we are being unduly influenced by a
> subliminal form of advertising. I am saying that we are dealing with
> people whose knowledge of human behavior is far superior to ours. We
> are dealing with people who know how to use our fears and emotions,
> our hopes and dreams, to achieve results that prioritize their goals
> over our own. They sing. We dance. They create an illusionary world
> that does not exist except in our expectations of what we need to live
> a happy, productive life. We begin to associate self-esteem with the
> products or services that we purchase. Without them we are less than
> adequate. Do you think you're not affected? Think again. We have lived
> with the glitter of Madison Avenue for so long that our vision is
> impaired. We think of ourselves as discriminating consumers who
> dictate our desires to the marketplace, when in fact the reverse is
> true. We have teenagers who are ashamed to go to school without a
> designer label on their bluejeans. In the Seventies insecure young
> Americans by the hundreds of thousands rode into Marlboro country with
> the Marlboro man and in doing so suffered and continue to suffer the
> consequences of respiratory illness. These Marlboro riders were
> "emulators"-targeted because of their insecurity. Today the Marlboro
> man is riding tall and proud in Third World countries. Most Third
> World countries do not require a warning label on cigarette packages,
> so the tobacco companies happily leave them off.

> But perhaps the most tragic aspect of all is that young people who
> grow up with a painful void of knowledge of self use the media to fill
> in the blanks. They adopt "Madison Avenue" values that include the
> assumption that all problems can be solved in one hour with plenty of
> time left over for commercial breaks. The conclusion then follows that
> a good life is possible through instantaneous solutions to complicated
> problems. In other words, there is little reason or need to sacrifice
> the present for future rewards.

> For democracy to survive, ordinary citizens must possess powers of
> reason sufficiently developed to checkmate those willing to abuse the
> communications media. The push buttons that operate our home
> electronic media offer the naive an illusion of control.

> Six thousand years of recorded human history offers little evidence of
> human purpose, yet it suggests a great deal about the nature of
> humans. It is incredible that we do not use this evidence. The
> knowledge of human experience that is necessary to understand oneself
> is, as I have already said, largely ignored by the educational system.
> The time to broach the subjects that hold the keys to self-knowledge
> such as human feelings, human needs, psychology, motivation,
> personalities, social interaction, ethnicity, and the art and science
> of getting along with others is when we are young enough to assimilate
> the knowledge into our behavior. But these subjects are taboo until
> such time as we have already become rigid in personality and behavior.
> These subjects are inexact sciences and are by their very nature
> highly subjective. They do not fit the classroom demand for right
> answers. The result is that we ignore dealing with the very questions
> which are most important to us. We should intuitively do the opposite.

> Self-knowledge is an anchor in social equilibrium. If we are
> comfortable with ourselves, we are less uncomfortable with others.
> Knowledge of others leads to understanding. Understanding leads to
> empathy. Empathy enables us to accept the differences of others
> without resorting to conflict to reduce those differences.

> If we were treated as if we had a greater capacity for understanding
> ourselves from early childhood, we would grow into adulthood seeing
> ourselves very differently from the way we do today. We would seek
> knowledge instead of hiding from it. We would see ourselves as
> "thinkers" capable of self determination. We would be comfortable with
> ambiguity. Change would be an ally.

> It is incredible that what we have learned of the nature of humans
> since philosopher-psychologist William James (1842-1910) wrote
> Principles of Psychology in 1890, has not been integrated into our
> educational system. How can we know others if we don't know ourselves?
> How can we make personal choices if we don't understand personal cause
> and effect?

> An understanding of the personal sciences, their limitations and their
> truths, significantly reduces our vulnerability to the various forms
> of mysticism. A major thesis of this book is that belief must be based
> on good reasons. It does not mean we can never trust authority, but
> simply that we should not do so blindly. It is neither practical nor
> desirable to think we must go through life having to prove everything
> to ourselves, or that we can never place our trust in others. But it
> is equally impractical to assume that we will not often require proof
> or that we should not question the authority in which we have placed
> our trust. The object is not to weaken belief, but to discover and
> strengthen it through the maturation of conviction.

> The wisdom of the ancient Greeks can be seen in the admission of their
> acknowledged ignorance. Socrates was a man who knew that he did not
> know." We, on the other hand, who are no match for the wisdom of
> Socrates, have the audacity to think that some person or computer can
> provide an answer for almost any question. We believe that we have the
> power of answers. But power lies in the quality and nature of
> questions. Learn how to question and you take charge of your
> education. Period.

> Suppose you are suddenly approached and taken into custody by a police
> officer. The officer takes you before a judge and jury, where the
> judge tells you that the world is in a state of crisis. There is only
> enough food for one-third of the present population; two-thirds of the
> population must be eliminated or humanity is doomed. The judge
> instructs you to convince the jury why you should be spared. You turn
> to face the jury and the foreman asks, "What are your goals?" Seeing
> that you are a little shaken, he offers you a chair and hands you a
> pen and a blank sheet of paper. He says, "Here, write them down. You
> have ten minutes." Put this book down and try this yourself.

> We are culturized to believe that failure is abhorrent and that
> whenever we fail it is simply because we did not try hard enough.
> However, failure and success are both the residue of effort, and the
> fear of one should not discourage the other. When we are afraid to
> fail, we fail to grow.

> Unfortunately, because we are human, we can never really escape from a
> perception of reality that is not contaminated from the frailties of
> human experience. The best we can do is pretend we are not involved,
> or that we have no personal stake in what we trying to be objective
> about. It helps if you can get into the habit of assuming the
> temporary identity of an inanimate object when a situation in which
> you are involved calls for objectivity. It is one step beyond the
> third person to that of a non-person. Pretend you are a rock, a
> mountain, a tree, anything with an imaginary non-human perspective of
> its own. The point is simply to assume a posture which enables you to
> view the antics of humans with a dispassionate sense of amusement, or
> a mild sense of curiosity. With practice you will be able to see
> through the walls we have engineered with narrow beliefs and prejudice
> to protect and promote our own versions of reality.

> The utility of an education is like that of a ball with a lead core.
> If the education is well rounded, the lead will settle in the center
> and the ball will roll easily in any direction. If, however, an
> education is without balance, the lead will settle near the surface
> and, regardless of how the ball is thrown, will revert to the same
> position. The longer it sits in one position, the less likely it will
> be able to regain mobility. If we do not continually work toward a
> whole education, we lose our ability to move in any direction freely
> and our ability to be self determining.
