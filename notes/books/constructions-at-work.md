# Learning generalizations

## How argument structure constructions are learned

Children can disrcover word segmentation, phrase boundaries, and grammatical categories from distributional data. Good start. But what about more abstract properties – like argument structures and linking rules?

### Learning argument structure generalizations

Reliable argument structure–meaning links exist in language. Children *might* take advantage of these [some experimental evidence suggests they do]. How would they do it?

"the ideas presented [in this chapter] are not actually exclusive to a constructionist account."

1. **Innate linking rules** mapping syntactic patterns to semantic templates (Baker 1988, Chomsky 1982, Pinker 1989). People supporting this view typically resort to AoA arguments (Naigles 1990; Fisher 1996; Hirsh-Pasek, Golinkoff, & Naigles 1996).
2. **Learned linking rules** "on the basis of general categorization strategies." Empirical data here is "the conservative nature of children's early learning, with demonstrations focusing on children's failure to generalize beyond the input until learnes have been exposed to a vast amount of data." [Sounds like it conflicts with the data the nativists point at?] (Akhtar & Tomasello, 1997). "Constructions must be learned, since they are acquired so late and in such a piecemeal fashion."

[right, as presented, it really seems like the camps are talking past each other. But we need to look at the actual data...]

How to reconcile the debate? "*Training studies* are required ... since such studies allow the input and the target construction to be manipulated." e.g. Childers & Tomasello (2001).

[some psycholinguistic evidence of adults implicitly learning new constructions: Kaschak & Goldberg (2004)]

[citation of Newport determiner studies, but I don't see how they arbitrate this debate]

### Skewed input

Goldberg, Casenhiser, Sethuraman (2004): common verb frames in CDS input are dominated by just a few verbs:

- SVO appears 39% of the time with *go*
- SVO+Obl appears 38% of the time with *put*
- SV + double obj appears 20% of the time with *give*

[I wouldn't call this a "strong tendency" as they do ..]

[I don't see why this is being brought up. You might bring it up to argue against construction learning, since there is little evidence to generalize above the level of a single word-type. Ah, I see:]

> The generality of the meanings of these verbs and thier highly frequent and early appearance in children's speech [and CDS] suggests that they may aid children in generalizing patterns from the input.

[interesting idea here, illustrated first (?) by Kay:]

> It is possible to think of the argument structure patterns as in some sense 'derived from' the semantics of their most neutral verbs (Kay, 1996).

> The present hypothesis is that the high frequency of particular verbs in particular constructions facilitates children's unconsciously establishing a correlation between the meaning of a particular verb in a constructional pattern and the pattern itself, giving rise to an association between meaning and form.
