## The ontology of linguistic theory

What is the ontological status of the elements of linguistic theory? There are three traditional positions on the matter:

1. **Nominalism** (Bloomfield, early Quine, Goodman): linguistics describes token physical objects/events.
2. **Cognitivism** (Chomsky, Fodor): linguistic theory describes mental constructs, states, cognitive processes.
3. **Realism/Platonism/abstractism** (Frege, Katz, Postal, Langendoen): linguistic theory describes *abstracta*: entities without causal power or spatiotemporal extension, only accessible mentally via intuition.

### Juicy history

> [Jerry] Katz argues that there have been two major revolutions in recent thinking about language. First, under the influence of Russell, Wittgenstein,  Carnap, and Quine, the analysis of linguistic expressions displaced metaphysics and epistemology as the central focus of philosophical theorizing in the first half of the twentieth century. Accordingly, philosophers became interested in linguistics, in an effort to put their theories on what seemed to be a more secure footing—a project that remains alive in much contemporary work. Second, under Chomsky’s influence, generative grammar came to prominence as the most fertile approach to linguistic analysis. (p. 3)

### A quick defeat of abstractism

Realism/Platonism/abstractism has often been supported by an appeal to the infinitude of possible linguistic structures. The straw-man claims that no finite physical substrate could ever capture such infinity.[^1] The response to the straw-man:

> The idea here is that the infinitude of language is *not* a datum. Indeed, it's not even *true* that there are, in existence, infinitely many linguistic tokens or types (nor that there have ever been, nor that there will ever be). Rather, the **infinitude is an artifact of theory construction**--specifically, a reflection of the fact that we seek maximally wide generalizations in our effort to accommodate *any* potential datum that we might encounter. &hellip; the point holds with respect to *all* serious systematic inquiry, on account of its being a virtue of *any* descriptive-explanatory theory that its generalizations be maximally broad.

[^1]: The chapter goes into some detail about what sort of infinite cardinality we're dealing with. I don't think it's worth recapitualting here for my purposes.

### Cognitivism

> Central to [Chomsky's] view is the idea that human beings are innately endowed with a dedicated neural structure for acquiring and using language. This "mental organ," which Chomsky calls the Language Faculty (FL), houses representations of various rules and principles for assigning internal structure to linguistic expressions. On this view, the object of linguistic inquiry is, in the first instance, a *psychological* entity---i.e., a person's "linguistic competence." Chomsky identifies this with what he calls an "**I-language**"---a body of domain-specific *knowledge* or *information* that every competent speaker has at his or her disposal.

Our end goal is to describe this I-language, where the *I* stands for three very distinct things:

- *internal:* an inner mental construct
- *individual:* describing an idiolect
- *intensional:* describing possible, not actually realized, states

> On the basis of this cognitive conception of language, Chomsky claims that there is no difference between a grammar's being "psychologically real" and its being simply *true* (23).

The true I-language is incorporated by a "parser, which assigns a percept to a signal" (MP p. 18). The important consequence of this last claim is that the grammar need not resemble the psychological processes which implement it:[^2]

> this framework of grammatical theory cannot serve directly as a model of processing &hellip; So [for example] the notion of derivation has been distanced from processing by calling it "metaphorical"; this term has been applied especially to processes of syntactic "movement." (Jackendoff 2000, pp. 21--22)

The I-language, then, is an element of Chomsky's notion of linguistic **competence**; its incorporation/recruitment within psychological processes is an element of **performance**.

Does such a division leave a theory of "competence" which is falsifiable / refutable? We can pick many amusing quotes in the negative direction:

> All data that the grammar cannot treat are shunted off into the domain of 'performance' and are excluded from consideration as nonissues. (de Beaugrande, 1980)

This goes too far, of course. Competence theories are grounded in empirical data, and do have some clear division from performance issues. (DP gives an example of pro-drop acceptability in English versus Italian -- no one would dispute that this is a competence issue; the ratings do not differ due to "performance errors.")

[^2]: DP points out that some early Chomsky work did actually make this claim (e.g. Miller & Chomsky 1963).

### Devitt's nominalism: the "Linguistic Conception"

Devitt claims that cognitivism rests on strong and dubious theses such as the Representational Thesis (RT):

> **Representational Thesis**: A speaker of a language stands in an unconscious or tacit propositional attitude to the rules or principles of the language, which are represented in her language faculty.

So what are grammars theories *of* according to Devitt, if not psychological states or mechanisms?

Token linguistic expressions are acoustic blasts or scribbles of ink, chalk, etc. Individuation and persistence conditions of linguistic expressions depend on "ineliminable reference[s] to the psychological states of competent speakers."

> A token physical entity or process counts as belonging to a particular type of linguistic expressionn in virtue of three factors:
>
> 1. the communicative intentions of its author,
> 2. the psychological state that it is used to convey,
> 3. and its relations to other linguistic expressions.

#### Significant metaphysical issues

##### Individuation of linguistic expressions

Devitt claims the above individuation conditions do *not* warrant the identification of linguistic expressions with Chomsky's "structural descriptions."

> The identity and persistence of a linguistic expression surely **supervenes** on psychological states, but the same can be said of any number of things that are plainly **not** psychological entities, e.g. the United States government.

The claim, then, is that others are mistaking a supervenience relation [between psychological states and linguistic behavior] for an identity/constituency relation.

**Objection**: if there were no people (&rArr; no psychological states), there would be no language. Thus language must be a psychological entity.

**Response**: This is exactly the confusion – marking language as *identical* with psychological states rather than *supervening* on them. Supervenience is all that is needed, and supervenience is consistent with the premise.

##### Irreducibility of linguistic properties

Problem: the attempt to derive phone types – even for the same speaker – has been a big failure.

> the structuralist dream of articulating "objective discovery procedures" for phonological categories has [thus] been abandoned (36)

This taxonomic approach has more generally failed across subfields of linguistics. From this failure, the conventional view concludes that phones, morphemes, and phrases must be psychological entities.

**Response**: We can conclude supervenience from the above reasoning as readily as we can conclude identity. Why conclude identity?

##### Infinitude of language

See above re: infinitude is not a datum, but an artifact of theory construction. There are finitely many linguistic tokens to study, but we don't know which ones we'll encounter ahead of time.

##### Ontology of null constituents

P&P theories posit null constituents (traces, ...).

>While the notion of an empty category helps the syntactician capture significant structural relationships and semantic regularities, it creates trouble for both the psycholinguist and the metaphysician.

> [on the standard view:] a person's I-language generates mental representations of hierarchical structure. In the course of language comprehension, these representations are **imposed** or **projected** on a speech stream or an inscription.

Q (Collins 2008): how can Devitt account for "the abstractness of syntax" which supports hierarchical analysis, representations of traces, etc.?

Rather than asserting the existence of representations, we can view such complexities as "high-level relations" instantiated across lots of different physical instances.

> Similarly, there are many complicated ways in which inscriptions can instantiate a letter; and so on for other linguistic media. But this does not
> show that the sounds, inscriptions, etc. do not instantiate SLEs [Standard Linguistic Entities]. Quite the contrary. The property of being Australian is instantiated by a vast variety of physical forms; for example, the forms of the capitalist Rupert Murdoch, the runner Cathy Freeman, the horse Phar Lap, the city of Sydney, a bottle of Penfolds Grange, and the many forms of the saying “No worries, mate”.
