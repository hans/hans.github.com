> If you lack a grand goal in living, you lack a coherent philosophy of life.

## General notes

Commonalities between Stoicism and Buddhist philosophy:

* Everything is transient. In Stoic terms, all our possessions are simply loaned to us by Fortune.
* One must live in and appreciate "this fleeting instant."

## Negative visualization

> Misfortune weighs most heavily, [Seneca] says, on those who "expect nothing but good fortune." Epictetus echoes this advice: We should keep in mind that "all things everywhere are perishable." If we fail to recognize this and instead go around assuming that we will always be able to enjoy the things we value, we will likely find ourselves subject to considerable distress when the things we value are taken from us.

**hedonic adaptation**: "We humans are unhappy in large part because we are insatiable; after working hard to get what we want, we routinely lose interest in the object of our desire. Rather than feeling satisfied, we feel a bit bored, and in response to this boredom, we go on to form new, even grander desires."

> besides finding a way to forestall the adaptation process, we need to find a way to reverse it. In other words, we need a technique for creating in ourselves a desire for the things we already have.

**negative visualization**: imagining that we have lost the things we value; "that our wife has left us, our car was stolen, or we lost our job"

> Remember that all we have is "on loan" from Fortune, which can reclaim it without our permission ... "we should love all of our dear ones ... but always with the thought that we have no promise that we may keep them forever - nay, no promise that we may keep them for long."

Epictetus: "In the very act of kissing the child, we should silently reflect on the possibility that she will die tomorrow."

> Thus, Epictetus counsels that when we say good-bye to a friend, we should silently remind ourselves that this might be our final parting.

> Seneca advises his friend Lucilius to ... live as if this very moment were our last.

> [Stoics] don't want us to stop thinking about or planning for tomorrow; instead they want us, as we think about and plan for tomorrow, to remember to appreciate today.

Also contemplate loss of material possessions: house, car, money; abilities: speech, movement

### But Stoics aren't pessimists

> We normally characterize an optimist as someone who sees his glass as being half full rather than half empty. For a Stoic, though, this degree of optimism would only be a starting point. After expressing his appreciation that his glass is half full rather than being completely empty, he will go on to express his delight in even having a glass. It could, after all, have been broken or stolen. And if he is atop his Stoic game, he might go on to comment about what an astonishing thing glass vessels are: They are cheap and fairly durable, impart no taste to what we put in them, and - miracle of miracles! - allow us to see what they contain.

## Projective visualization

> Epictetus advocates this sort of "projective visualization." Suppose, he says, that our servant breaks a cup. We are likely to get angry and have our tranquility disrupted by the incident. One way to avert this anger is to think about how we would feel if the incident had happened to someone else instead. If we were at someone's house and his servant broke a cup, we would be unlikely to get angry; indeed, we might try to calm our host by saying "It's just a cup; these things happen."

Makes us appreciate the "relative insignificance of the bad things that happen to us."

## Dichotomy of control

> Your primary desire, says Epictetus, should be your desire not to be frustrated by forming desires you won't be able to fulfill. Your other desires should conform to this desire, and if they don't, you should do your best to extinguish them.

Up to us: opinions, impulses, desires, aversions.
Not up to us: possessions and reputation.

> We can want things that are up to us, or we can want things that are not up to us.

Or, in a more logically sound statement as a true dichotomy,

> There are things over which we have complete control and things over which we don't have complete control.

Turn external goals into internal ones:

> When a Stoic concerns himself with things over which he has some but not complete control, such as winning a tennis match, he will be very careful about the goals he sets for himself. In particular, he will be careful to set internal rather than external goals. Thus, his goal in playing tennis will not be to win a match (something external, over which he has only partial control) but to play to the best of his ability in the match (something internal, over which he has complete control). By choosing this goal, he will spare himself frustration or disappointment should he lose the match: Since it was not his goal to win the match, he will not have failed to attain his goal, as long as he played his best. His tranquility will not be disrupted.

Goal transformation:

* I want to win a game of tennis -> I want to play as well as I can in a game of tennis
* I want my wife to love me -> I want to act as lovably as possible
* A novelist wants to be accepted by a publisher -> A novelist writes as best as she can

Always work to keep a dichotomy of control in your mind, distinguishing what is under your control (and merits effort / worrying) and what is not under your control (and thus does not merit worrying).

## Fatalism

> According to Seneca, we should offer ourselves to fate, inasmuch as "it is a great consolation that it is together with the universe we are swept along." According to Epictetus, we should keep firmly in mind that we are merely actors in a play written by someone else - more precisely, the Fates. We cannot choose our role in this play, but regardless of the role we are assigned, we must play it to the best of our ability. If we are assigned by the Fates to play the role of beggar, we should play the role well; likewise if we are assigned to play the role of king. If we want our life to go well, Epictetus says, we should, rather than wanting events to conform to our desires, make our desires conform to events; we should, in other words, want events "to happen as they do happen."

Stoics did not sit around and let fate take its course - they were not fatalistic about the **future** but rather about the **past**.

> the Stoics would not counsel a mother with a sick child to be fatalistic with respect to the future; she *should* try to nurse the child back to health (even though the Fates have already decided whether the child lives or dies). But if the child dies, they will counsel this women to be fatalistic with respect to the past. It is only natural, even for a Stoic, to experience grief after the death of a child. But to dwell on that death is a waste of time and emotions, inasmuch as the past cannot be changed. Dwelling on the child's death will therefore cause the woman needless grief.

This past-fatalist approach thus also fits with those who believe in free will.

Past-fatalism is basically an extension of the dichotomy of control - we can't control the past, and so there is no need to fret over it.

Stoics can still be ambitious:

> Stoic philosophy, while teaching us to be satisfied with whatever we've got, also counsels us to seek certain things in life. We should, for example, strive to become better people - to become virtuous in the ancient sense of the word. ... We should ... strive to do our social duty: This is why Seneca and Marcus felt compelled to participate in Roman government and why Musonius and Epictetus felt compelled to teach Stoicism.

Stoics will not seek fame and fortune, things which have no real value.

## Self-denial

> Instead of merely thinking about what it would be like to lose our wealth, we should periodically "practice poverty": We should, that is, content ourselves with "the scantiest and cheapest fare" and with "coarse and rough dress."

Musonius even thought it useful to inflict minor discomforts, such as going out in the cold without a coat or walking barefoot.

This is not pure masochism: 1) it hardens one against possible future misfortunes, 2) future discomforts will not cause anxiety, 3) it helps us appreciate the usual comforts one already has.

Periodically forego opportunities to experience pleasure.

> Indeed, pursuing pleasure, Seneca warns, is like pursuing a wild beast: On being captured, it can turn on us and tear us to pieces. Or, changing the metaphor a bit, he tells us that intense pleasures, when captured by us, become our captors, meaning that the more pleasures a man captures, "the more masters he will have to serve."

> This makes it sound as if Stoics are antipleasure, but they aren't. The Stoics see nothing wrong, for example, with enjoying the pleasures to be derived from friendship, family life, a meal, or even wealth, but they counsel us to be circumspect in our enjoyment of these things. There is, after all, a fine line between enjoying a meal and lapsing into gluttony.

These techniques applied over time lead to an immensely high amount of self-control.

## Meditation

Spend time after each day, reflecting on successes, mistakes, etc., and finding ways to create these successes / avert these failures in the future.

> "What ailment of yours have you cured today? What failing have you resisted? Where can you show improvement?"

> Did something disrupt his tranquility? Did he experience anger? Envy? Lust? Why did the day's events upset him? Is there something he could have done to avoid getting upset?

## Social relations

Social relations with others will naturally bring with them causes for the disruption of our tranquility. But Stoics were not hermits:

> man is by nature a social animal and ... we have a duty to form and maintain relationships with other people, despite the trouble they might cause us.

Dilemma: how to maintain tranquility while fulfilling duty of forming relationships?

* "Prepare for our dealings with other people before dealing with them." (?)
* "Avoid befriending people whose values have been corrupted."
* Be selective about the social functions you attend. Be circumspect in your conversation.

When you have to deal with an annoying person:

> Marcus recommends that when we interact with an annoying person, we keep in mind that there are doubtless people who find *us* to be annoying. More generally, when we find ourselves irritated by someone's shortcomings, we should pause to reflect on our own shortcomings.

**social fatalism**: "In our dealings with others, we should operate on the assumption that they are fated to behave in a certain way."

Use projective visualization to remind yourself of the triviality of annoying events in your life.

### Insults

When insulted, consider whether the insult is true. If it's true, why be upset?

> "Why is it an insult," Seneca asks, "to be told what is self-evident?"

Consider the source of the insult. If a disapproving insult comes from a contemptible person, you should be relieved - you are doing the right thing!

> When we consider the sources of insults, says Seneca, we will find that those who insult us can best be described as overgrown children. ... In other cases, we will find that those insulting us have deeply flawed characters. Such people, says Marcus, rather than deserving our anger, deserve our pity.

"Another person will not do you harm unless you wish it; you will be harmed at just that time at which you take yourself to be harmed." - Epictetus

> Suppose someone deprives me of my property. He has done me harm only if it is my opinion that my property had a real value.

In responding to an insult, humor (especially self-deprecating types) works best. If you can't think of a good response, carry on calmly as if the insulter had not even spoken.

### Grief

Stoics grieve too - it is a natural reflex.

> Seneca writes, "Nature requires from us some sorrow, while more than this is the result of vanity. But never will I demand of you that you should not grieve at all."

Negative visualization will help in minimizing grief when actual bad events occur.

**retrospective negative visualization**: imagining that we never had something we lost, being grateful for the time we *did* have it

### Anger

Being angry is a waste of precious time.

By hardening oneself using self-denial and "lightening up" using projective visualization and humor, events which may have made us angry in the past will now seem petty and not worth the lapse in tranquility.

> When we feel ourselves getting angry about something, we should pause to consider its cosmic (in)significance. Doing this might enable us to nip our anger in the bud.

If you do ever lash out in anger, immediately apologize and acknowledge your mistake(s).

> Why experience anti-joy when you have it in your power to experience joy?

## Personal values

> People are unhappy, the Stoics argue, in large part because they are confused about what is valuable. Because of their confusion, they spend their days pursuing things that, rather than making them happy, make them anxious and miserable.

### Fame

Be indifferent to social status. (Conceal your indifference if showing it might negatively impact the happiness of others.)

By relying on fame to fuel happiness, you put your tranquility **in the hands of others**. You may restrict or alter your plans or actions to please those who control your joy. This is foolish!

Be as dismissive to the approval of others as to the disapproval of others.

This is consistent with the "dichotomy of control" philosophy: we can't completely control what others think of us, so why lend so much focus to it?

> Cato consciously did things to trigger the disdain of other people simply so he could practice ignoring their disdain.

### Wealth

With rising wealth comes the danger of hedonic adaptation.

Money is not the only form of wealth.

When dealing with money, remember to engage in negative visualization.

---

> The joy the Stoics were interested in can best be described as a kind of objectless enjoyment - an enjoyment not of any particular thing but of *all this*. It is a delight in simply being able to participate in life. It is a profound realization that even though all this didn't have to be possible, it *is* possible - wonderfully, magnificently possible.
