# A functional analysis of verbal behavior

This introductory word-dance serves to both state the book's focus and also to warn the reader that this won't be any old psychology book. No, this is one where we'll need to work from first principles.. starting with a name for the analysis itself (p. 35):

> Behavior which is effective only through the mediation of other persons has so many distinguishing dynamic and topographical properties that a special treatment is justified and, indeed, demanded. Problems raised by this special mode of action are usually assigned to the field of speech or language. Unfortunately, the term “speech” emphasizes vocal behavior and is only awkwardly applied to instances in which the mediating person is affected visually, as in writing a note. “Language” is now satisfactorily remote from its original commitment to vocal behavior, but it has come to refer to the practices of a linguistic community rather than the behavior of any one member. The adjective “linguistic” suffers from the same disadvantage. The term "verbal behavior" has much to recommend it. Its etymological sanction is not too powerful, but it *emphasizes the individual speaker* and, whether recognized by the user or not, *specifies behavior shaped and maintained by mediated consequences*[^1]. It also has the advantage of being relatively unfamiliar in traditional modes of explanation.

This book analyzes verbal behavior as performed at the instance-level. Not language as an object, but the act of producing and responding to verbal moves.

Success conditions are something like reducing verbal behavior to a deterministic/predictable system of causes and effects (p. 36):

> The extent to which we understand verbal behavior in a “causal” analysis is to be assessed from the extent to which we can predict the occurrence of specific instances and, eventually, from the extent to which we can produce or control such behavior by altering the conditions under which it occurs.

[^1]: We should take this as only a very preliminary definition. The rest of the book will focus on working out this definition..

## Traditional formulations

(in which Skinner (perhaps echoing a later Wittgenstein) tears apart decades of work in linguistics, especially semantics, as philosophically misguided)

pp. 38–39:

> It has generally been assumed that to explain behavior, or any aspect of it, one must attribute it to *events taking place inside the organism*. In the field of verbal behavior this practice was once represented by the doctrine of the expression of ideas. An utterance was felt to be explained by setting forth the ideas which it expressed. …
> 
> Such a practice obviously has the same goal as a causal analysis, but ithas by no means the same results. The difficulty is that the ideas for which sounds are said to stand as signs cannot be independently observed. …
> 
> There is obviously something suspicious in the ease with which we discover in a set of ideas precisely those properties needed to account for the behavior which expresses them. W e evidently construct the ideas at will from the behavior to be explained. There is, of course, no real explanation.

This talk sounds a bit straw-man-y so far. But replace "idea" with "meaning" and Skinner suggests this is basically modern semantics.. (p. 40):

> The basic formulation [of above—i.e. reverse explanation of behavior in terms of unobservable, loosey-goosey theoretical constructs], however, has been preserved. The immediate successor to “idea” was “meaning,” and the place of the latter is in danger of being usurped by a newcomer, “information.” These terms all have the same effect of discouraging a functional analysis and of supporting, instead, some of the practices first associated with the doctrine of ideas.

And here comes what I take to be echoes of the late Wittgenstein. This talk of underlying meaning leads us to mistakenly attribute an independent existence to its constituent tokens (words, logical forms, etc.), p. 40:

> One unfortunate consequence is the belief that speech has an independent existence apart from the behavior of the speaker. … although the formal properties of the records of utterances [transcriptions, audio recordings] are interesting, we must preserve the distinction between an activity and its traces. In particular we must avoid the unnatural formulation of verbal behavior as the “use of words.”

Followed by a pretty heavy example. I think the point here is that we have a tendency to analyze language in terms of atomic units separate from the process of production/understanding, while we don't have the same tendency for, say, physical human behavior.

> We have no more reason to say that a man "uses the word *water*" in asking for a drink than to say that he "uses a reach" in taking the offered glass.

We make the same mistake in believing that "meaning" is something independent from verbal behavior:

> A complementary practice has been to assign an independent existence to meanings. “Meaning,” like “idea,” is said to be something expressed or communicated by an utterance. … The concept has certain advantages. Where “ideas” (like “feelings” and “desires,” which are also said to be expressed by words) must be inside the organism, there is a promising possibility that meanings may be kept outside the skin.

After recounting several classic problems in lexical meaning, we proceed to taking down the idea of a "proposition" (p. 41):

> The existence of meanings becomes even more doubtful when we advance from single words to those collocations which “say something.” What is said by a sentence is something more than what the words in it mean. Sentences do not merely refer to trees and skies and rain, they say something about them. This something is sometimes called a “proposition”—a somewhat more respectable precursor of speech but very similar to the “idea” which would have been said to be expressed by the same sentence under the older doctrine. To define a proposition as “something which may be said in any language” does not tell us where propositions are, or of what stuff they are  made. Nor is the problem solved by defining a proposition as all the sentences which have the same meaning as some one sentence, since we cannot identify a sentence as a member of this class without knowing its meaning—at which point we find ourselves facing our original problem.

We wrap up with another extremely dense critical paragraph, which I'll try to piece apart after the quotation (p. 43):

> We could no doubt define ideas, meanings, and so on, so that they would be scientifically acceptable and even useful in describing verbal behavior. But such an effort to retain traditional terms would be costly. It is the general formulation which is wrong. We seek “causes” of behavior which have an acceptable scientific status and which, with luck, will be susceptible to measurement and manipulation. To say that these are “all that is meant by” ideas or meanings is to misrepresent the traditional practice. We must find the functional relations which govern the verbal behavior to be explained; to call such relations “expression” or “communication” is to run the danger of introducing extraneous and misleading properties and events. The only solution is to reject the traditional formulation of verbal behavior in terms of meaning.

My parse of this paragraph, which is intended to summarize the section:

1. A successful description of verbal behavior should be a causal description mapping dealing principally in observable events (which are "susceptible to measurement and manipulation").
2. A standard study of "meaning" does not fit this bill. Theories of meaning provide just-so explanations of observed phenomena (linguistic utterances). If we center our system description around these ideas, we are in "danger of introducing extraneous and misleading properties and events."
3. We need to formulate a study of verbal behavior which does not include external *meanings* as a first-class type.
