# Sound

I am fascinated by sound. The enormous range of pitch, timbre, and volume in the medium connect directly to our emotions in ways that vision or language rarely do. Everyday life presents us with sounds so varied in quality and rich in texture, but we seldom stop to notice. On this page, I do my best to stop and notice.

 Some of my favorite sound scenes are what other people might describe as "silence." Here's a bit from a neighborhood street in West Village, New York City.

I've started collecting recordings from my city and from my travels around the world. Most of these recordings are of beautiful textured noise in public places â€“ metro stations, coffee shops, streets, etc. I hope these make someone else as happy as they make me.
