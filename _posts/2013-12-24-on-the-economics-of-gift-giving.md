title: On the economics of gift-giving
excerpt: Why do we give presents rather than cash? What makes some gifts offensive and others lovely?

Christmas, birthdays, graduations, housewarming parties --- all wonderful times
to celebrate and reunite with family and friends. But for me, beneath that
celebration lies that haunting specter of *the gift*.

I'm terrible at finding good gifts for people. Maybe I was one of those born
without the proper genes. In any case, for people like me celebrations always
come with a bit of dread as I wonder what gifts to buy for good friends and
family.

I've often asked myself whether it would be appropriate to ditch the standard
plan and simply wrap some cash in an envelope along with a nice letter. It makes
perfect sense, I think: given that I lack any sort of skill in selecting goods
that other people might enjoy, it would be better to simply let the giftee
decide what he or she wants. With cash the receiver can choose to buy any of the
potential gifts I was considering, or *anything else* that he might prefer. Then
everyone is better off: I don't sink hours into fruitless gift searches and end
up buying the wrong thing, and the person receiving the gift instead gets to buy
exactly what he has always wanted.[^1] So cash is okay, right?

The answer is almost universally no.[^2] I began to undertand why this is so
just a few weeks ago as I listened to [Russ Roberts][1] and [Michael Munger][2]
discuss the economics of gifts in an [EconTalk episode][3]. The two discuss the
common scenario of a dinner party, where guests are often expected to arrive
with a small gift in hand. Most guests would arrive with a bottle of wine,
chocolates, or maybe some flowers. Wouldn't the most "thoughtful" guest be the
one that arrives with a $20, though --- the guest that lets the host decide what
would be best for himself? Obviously not.

### Why don't we give cash?

Munger uses Aristotle's theory of value, which decomposes the concept of "value"
into a subjective and idiosyncratic *value of use* and a more universal *value
of exchange*, to justify why we are so repulsed by the $20 gift.


[^1]: And perhaps most importantly, I have signaled by giving this gift that I care about the giftee. So much so, in fact, that I've prized his/her interest above all in choosing to give a cash gift.
[^2]: For the record, I have gone through with this strategy several times... albeit with widely varying degrees of success.
