—as I walked down a quiet side-street in Cambridge, not far from Central
Square. I was glued to my phone and couldn't make out so many details without
looking up, but I could see that it was middle-sized and black, facing me and angled to the north-east.

I could tell this was a dog not only from its shape, but also from that
primitive *thwang* that triggers within me when I encounter a dog in public.
I'm not afraid of dogs – I've spent most of my life near one canine or another–but am still wary around random dogs on the street, leashed or not. Maybe it's an adaptive instinct, or maybe it's just me acting out my role as Safety Sam.

In any case, I felt that *thwang* as I registered the dog's basic features. Black, medium size – maybe a black labrador. I raised my head, ready to step out of the way, smile at the owner, follow the basic program. But there was no dog in front of me.

What was in front of me was not a black labrador, but a commuter bike locked to
a slightly oblique street sign. The bike had a thin black seat and narrow road
tires, with a rusty pannier rack framing its back wheel. Its handlebars – drop
bars, taped black – were angled away from me. No dog in sight.

How could my own experience of the world be so *wrong?*

Am I pathological? I don't think so. I've been noticing more of these
experiences over the past few months. Sights, sounds, and sensations occasionally reveal themselves to be little fibs: reasonable, but ultimately inaccurate, pictures of what is *actually* out there in the real world.

What produces such fibs? My mind seems to be "filling in" the rough picture provided to it by my sensory systems: adding color, labeling objects, and so on. Making everything look tidy.

The human retina contains two major types of [light-sensitive cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoreceptor_cell):[^1] rods and cones. Rods are responsible for vision in low light, and are not sensitive to color. Cones respond only in high light, and support color vision.

These two types of cells are distributed unequally in the retina. Cones cluster around the area of the retina which maps to the center of our visual field (the [fovea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fovea)), while rods dominate everywhere else.

This distribution suggests that the majority of the color information processed in my retina is limited to just the very center of my visual field.[^2]

That's puzzling, because it doesn't seem to map onto my experience. I certainly don't think that my color vision is limited to the very center of my visual field.[^3] How could I perceive the world as fully colored, if my sensory machinery could not possibly yield such an image? If that underlying hardware is yielding only a sparse picture of the real world, why does color feel so [abundant](http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/02/is-consciousness-sparse-or-abundant.html) in my visual experience?

TODO filling in

TODO positive conclusion?

[^1]: Fun fact. There is actually a third type with quite a long name: [intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsically_photosensitive_retinal_ganglion_cells). These cells (a ~1% minority in the retina) help regulate circadian rhythms and contribute to melatonin production/suppression. They were first hypothesized after scientists discovered that supposedly blind mice were still able to respond to changes in their visual environment.
[^2]: This is not exactly correct, of course. It's likely that I rapidly and subconsciously saccade in order to gather information about colors in my periphery. I don't pretend to cover all my bases as a vision scientist here – I only pretend to get the broad strokes of this argument correct.
[^3]: I also don't think that my peripheral vision is especially acute in low-light conditions.
