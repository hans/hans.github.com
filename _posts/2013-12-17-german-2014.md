title: German 2014
excerpt: A new year, a new language. I discuss the reasoning for establishing this year-long goal and detail the techniques I plan to use this year to follow through.
---

I began 2013 with several lofty goals related to language learning:

- Become conversational in Romanian
- Become conversational in German
- Switch to the Spain accent of Spanish and increase fluency[^1]

I think I've done fairly well in accomplishing the first and last goals, but
there's no doubt that I dropped the ball with regards to German. I started off
the year right with an ambitious German vocabulary Anki deck, but did little
practice apart from this simplistic vocabulary study. I never really took the
time to study it more than passively.

As an aspiring polyglot, I've had German on my "to-learn list" for quite a long
time. My skills have always been at this same uncomfortable level of stasis,
though. 2014 is the year to change that.

## Why learn a language?

I'm embarrassed that I haven't yet posted anything about linguistics or language
learning to this blog. Learning how to approach and understand foreign languages
has been a central part of my life since before my high school years. I love the
daunting challenge of comprehending something never before seen, and the
outstanding feeling of accomplishment that comes in a first successful
conversation with a native speaker.

There are more than intrinsic rewards, naturally. Speaking foreign languages
with others has brought me tremendous benefit, most notably in the bonds with
people that I otherwise would not have been able to form.[^2] Language brings me
closer with people more rapidly than anything else could.

After some time with each language, you reach a certain vantage point at which
the *culture* innately tied to the words you are speaking and writing becomes
visible. It's a really beautiful moment that's just impossible to express. This
is one of the real prizes hidden behind each language: a new perspective on
life, and new ideas about the self, the mind, the community, and so much more.

I could gush about any of these points and many more, but this is not the place.
I'd like to focus on the more important question for the moment---

## Why German?

I've been thinking about my next potential language for the last few months.
I've tossed around the likes of Latin, Russian, Norwegian, Mandarin, Catalan,
and German. These are all really fascinating from one linguistic standpoint or
another. Catalan and Russian have wonderful phonologies,[^3] for example, while
Norwegian and Latin are interesting to the amateur historical linguist /
etymology nerd within me.

For me, German has both of these features,[^4] along with a considerably more
practical advantage: all of my immediate family already speaks the language.
This guarantees me a source of speaking practice, and also offers me a new way
to communicate with the people I have known primarily through English my entire
life.

## How?

I love asking myself this question every time I take that first dive into a new
language. I change my routine slightly every time. Here's an (extremely) brief
summary of the strategies I've used over time:

- **Spanish (2006)**: Sit in a class with 30 other kids, expect to learn by
  osmosis
- **French (2008)**: Self-teach using language course books, maximize input
  (music, movies, radio, etc.) to simulate immersion and minimize grammar focus
  after first months
- **French revival (2010)**: Try to "unroot" French from my English with [UVAM][1]
- **Romanian (2013)**: Self-teach using Assimil[^5] (parallel texts without
  explicit grammar lessons), maximize input, and prioritize interaction with
  native speakers

My approach to German will be a synthesis of the strategies which have proven to
work well for me in the past and a few recommended techniques that I have yet to
give a chance.

### Assimil

I am so pleased with the results of the [Assimil method][2]. Polyglot
[Luca Lampariello][3] (along with a huge majority of the European language
learning community) has vocally supported Assimil as the best way to approach a
language as a complete beginner. I decided to give Assimil a chance with
Romanian, spending my first several months of study with
[*Le roumain sans peine*][4]. I couldn't imagine a better way to get such a
detailed picture of the real-world use of a language. The method worked
impressively well: it explicitly avoided grammar in the beginning stages of
learning (as is commonly recommended but not often followed), made constant use
of humor to make learning fun, and more subtly took advantage of spaced
repetition techniques to make learning effective. *Le roumain sans peine* left
me with a good foundation in Romanian that I was able to rely on as I continued
to more advanced techniques.

I'd like to follow the same introductory method with German as well.
[*German with Ease*][5] is on the to-buy list![^6]

### Universal vocabulary acquisition method

The Universal Vocabulary Acquisition Method (UVAM) is a vocabulary acquisition
technique I picked up from a now-extinct blog about midway into my French study.
The concept is pretty simple:

- Enter vocabulary into a flashcard system (preferably backed by
  [spaced repetition][5])
- The front side of each card should contain the L2 word or phrase
- The back side of each card should contain a *definition* and possibly
  *synonyms* of the L2 word **in the L2**.

Note that the learner's L1 --- English for me --- is involved nowhere in this
system. It's a fascinating idea that worked pretty significant wonders for my
French vocabulary, helping me to "unroot" my conception of the language from
English and allow me to think and translate directly from thought-matter to
French rather than having to first make a pit-stop in English.

Of course, the UVAM is only useful to learners who have already attained enough
vocabulary to get the crux of a dictionary definition of a word. This isn't too
tall of an order, though --- depending on the language, this might take
somewhere between a week and a month at most.

### All German, all the time

I somehow failed to discover [All Japanese All The Time][6] until only a few
months ago. This site is packed full with novel and seemingly useful techniques
for language learning, and I'd like to take advantage of one that I find
particularly promising: constant audio immersion.

In the AJATT spirit, I'm going to try to surround myself with German whenever
possible. This means finding lots of interesting German audio content that I can
stream into my ears throughout the day. The goal is not to always actively
listen --- merely to sustain the experience of listening to German. Whenever
it's not mentally taxing, I can take a half-minute to try to repeat a specific
difficult phrase, or mimic an interesting pattern of stress or tone.

To start, I'll be drawing primarily from two sources:

- Deutsche Welle's podcast [Langsam Gesprochene Nachrichten][7], or "Slowly
  Spoken News." This is a broadcast designed for beginners who want to add to
  their German vocabulary and get a taste of spoken German without suffering
  from typical incomprehensible rapid news-speech.
- [PodClub][8], a site which hosts several slowly spoken German-language
  podcasts (designed for beginners)

Of course, as my German improves these sources will not be as entertaining. I
plan to move to [TuneIn][9] once I find some reliable stations and reach a point
where I can keep up a reasonable amount of comprehension.

### Learning with Texts

As I finish with Assimil and get over the hump of elementary vocabulary,
[Learning with Texts][11] will become my primary place for reading practice and
vocabulary acquisition. I'll couple this practice tightly with UVAM, recording
new words I encounter in German-language sources immediately into an SRS
application.

### Rapping and music sing-alongs

This is a silly little technique that I began using late into my Romanian
studies. I'd like to continue this strategy with German, and possibly make it a
more central part of the beginning learning phase. It's a fun way to get an
intimate sense of the rhythm of a language, and how its speakers play with
stress and pronunciation to make their compositions work.

I have some special tricks for learning foreign-language raps which likely merit
a separate post at some point. I'll leave this for another day.

### Plan

As the new year approaches, I intend to develop a more concrete plan concerning
my approach to German, detailing which techniques will be utilized at which
points during the year. This plan should appear in this space at some point over
the remaining weeks of 2013.

## Conclusion: staying accountable

As I wrote in my [winter 2014 goals post][10], I'll be providing regular public
updates of my progress in German. I've yet to decide what is the best medium for
this --- I could post videos to YouTube, post audio snippets here, or maybe take
advantage of SoundCloud's timed comments and upload my speaking practice
sessions there. In any case, I know that public accountabililty is the best way
to keep myself honest about my progress and find motivation to keep working on
German alongside my other commitments.

I'm excited to begin with this plan! Without a doubt this is the most rigorous
and ambitious language learning goal I've ever set. We'll see how it plays out
in 2014. For now, *gute nacht!*

[^1]: No, as the many native Spanish speakers I live with can confirm, I am still far from being a "fluent" speaker.
[^2]: I should qualify my statements here: I don't claim fluency in any language but English (and even that is a stretch at times). Absolute fluency is not necessary, however, to experience such benefits.
[^3]: IMHO.
[^4]: Yes, German has a beautiful sound to my ears. I don't agree at all with the common sentiment that German is "harsh" --- I've heard rapid French that sounds much more guttural and "harsh" than the average German conversation.
[^5]: My base for Romanian was French --- that is, my early studies were dominated by content written in French for French speakers.
[^6]: Assimil is pretty expensive. The books can be gotten for a relative steal online as used books. (You have to be careful about the series, though --- the quality of the Assimil books for some languages has varied pretty greatly over the three or four series that the company has published since mid-last century.)
