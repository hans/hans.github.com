excerpt: Week of November 24, 2013

I've decided to join the Internet-wide trend of posting regular updates on
articles, blog posts, etc. that I have read recently and find interesting. I see
multiple benefits in such a practice:

- **As a commitment mechanism:** With the Internet watching, I will (hopefully)
  feel more motivated to maintain good reading habits. Furthermore, I'll have an
  incentive to write about my insights on each piece (these posts would
  otherwise be of no more value than any other news aggregation).
- **As a more effective method of sharing:** Individual posts on social networks
  often seem "drowned out" to me, quickly eclipsed by the slightly newer
  articles displayed immediately above it. This form of more formal publication
  should counter that effect.
- **As a log of my reading progress:** I envision an archive of my reading
  interests over the weeks / months / years[^1] could be very useful to my
  future self.

Without further ado, here begins the Sunday Links series![^2]

- Sean Trende from RealClearPolitics [claims that House campaign spending][2]
  only has significant effects for challengers. This post is based on findings
  from the late 80's / early 90's. [Levitt (1994)][3] contradicts these ideas
  and suggests that the marginal dollar of funding actually does little for both
  the incumbent and the challenger, after controlling for candidate quality and
  performing more than a simple cross-sectional analysis (as Trende has done).
- [Varshney et al. (2013)][4] describe a system for
  [computational creativity][5]. The system combines many disparate datasets on
  cuisine and food ingredients (containing data concerning e.g. regional cooking
  practices, observed links between chemicals and "hedonic [psychophysical][6]
  effects," olfactory properties, etc. etc.) and automatically designs and
  assesses "creative" novel meal recipes.
- F. A. Hayek's article ["The Use of Knowledge in Society"][9] explains how a
  free market can resolve the problem of insufficient knowledge on the part of
  any given individual through prices. Hayek claims that a system of central
  planning would require a single entity with total knowledge of the
  circumstances of all of its constituents, and argues that a decentralized
  system which regulates itself by prices is superior.
- David Luposchainsky [provides examples][8] of [strange loops][7] in Haskell
  with two simple functions, `loeb` and `moeb`.
