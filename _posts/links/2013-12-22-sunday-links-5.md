- [*"I, Pencil"*][1] trumpets the self-organizing wonders of the free market in
  parable form. Not one single person on this earth, it claims, knows how to
  produce a pencil from scratch. It takes millions of people working together to
  accomplish such a feat. Moreover, all these people working together toil not
  in the interest of global pencil production rates but rather in the interest
  of feeding their families. The output is a mere side effect![^1]
- Scott Alexander's
  [*"A Something Sort of Like Left-Libertarianism-ist Manifesto"*][2] details
  how free-market solutions can solve real social problems. I'll have to read
  more about this "bleeding-heart libertarianism" that he discusses.
- [*"The Facebooking of Economics"*][3][^2] gives a view into how modern
  economics discourse operates. The bleeding edge debates don't always happen in
  peer-reviewed journals anymore --- they're also present on the blogs of
  economists across the web!
- [*"On the Folly of Rewarding A, While Hoping for B"*][6] gives some
  interesting examples of perverse incentives in public policy and management.
- [*"The Thought Leader"*][4] and (published a day later!)
  [*"We are nothing (and that is beautiful)"*][5] air troubling concerns about
  what our generation has been taught about success (and how our visions
  actually play out in the long run). This topic merits substantial discussion,
  but I'll need to think more before putting forth any ideas on this medium.
