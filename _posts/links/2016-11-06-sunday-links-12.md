1. [Whither Speech Recognition?][1]
2. [**Is the mind just an accident of the universe?**][2] A very brief
   introduction to panpsychism.
3. [**Three ways you might still be racist.**][3] Eric Schwitzgebel spells out
   how eliminating consistent overt racist behavior is not the same thing as
   not being a racist. I think it's very good to clearly designate these other
   less obvious moral violations. As a result, we'll be forced to recognize our
   own "moral mediocrity" (Eric's phrase). The unacceptable alternative is to
   pretend we are morally perfect and not leave any room to keep learning. This
   is the default state of the non-critical modern liberal.
