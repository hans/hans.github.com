excerpt: Week of December 15, 2013

The quarter is over, and I'm back at home with the family. Tomorrow I'll return
for a few weeks contracting at [Stremor][1]. Here's what I've been reading this
week:

- [**Aaron (1994)**][3] attacks the idea of treating the preferences and values
  of an individual as stable as more of an "axiom of religious faith" than a
  "defensible scientific hypothesis" (6). He supports approaches such as that of
  [Epstein and Axell][4], which avoid unrealistic oversimplified models of
  utility that Aaron claims have plagued microeconomics for too long.
- Bertrand Russell gives the [**10 commandments of "true liberalism"**][5] ---
  worth a read for any student, learner, thinker, etc.
- [**Yandle (1983)**][6] gives an outline of his catchy concept of "bootleggers
  and baptists." For those unacquainted with the bridge between public policy
  and economics (read: me), this is a really enlightening read.
- Rudolf Weinstock's [**The Lisp Curse**][2] makes a poignant statement about
  software development: the people developing may be as affected by their tools
  as they affect their environment. Technology affects our social behavior.
