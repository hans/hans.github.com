Happy April! I've been slacking on these link posts.. I'm hoping to launch
myself back into the habit with a varied collection of links today:

- [**No one really knows if HFT is good or bad.**][1] The econoblogosphere has
  been on fire this past week with the release of Michael Lewis' book
  [*Flash Boys*][2], which exposes to the general public some of the more
  nefarious aspects of high-frequency trading. This post by Noah Smith is a
  candid admission of the fact that we really don't have the tools at this point
  to conclude whether many HFT practices (barring those obviously egregious
  techniques like front-running) help or hinder the stock market. See also
  ["High Speed Trading and Slow-Witted Economic Policy"][3] and
  ["Flash Boys for the People"][4].
- [***The Alchemists: Three Central Bankers and a World On Fire***][7] revealed
  to me just how pivotal a role central bankers of the world have had in the
  recent recession and the subsequent recovery. The amount of engineering that
  these institutions---most notably, the Federal Reserve, ECB, and Bank of
  England---perform in hopes of maintaining stable employment and moderate
  inflation is just astounding.
- [**"The value of time as a student"**][8] asks a question that has been
  bothering me for some time: why do students of extraordinary intellectual
  aptitude (and no immediate financial burdens) take on menial campus jobs?
  Katja Grace suggests: "It seems that college students generally treat their
  time as low value." We trade this time for small immediate returns, perhaps
  unable to conceive of how spending this same time on more positive engagements
  (reading, meeting with professors, building things) could yield much greater
  long-term returns.
- [**"No country for old members"**][5] models the linguistic change of
  communities, and reaches some interesting conclusions about how language
  change tells a story about the "age" or character of a community.
- [**"I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that"**][6] is now my go-to resource
  for explaining some of the struggles of natural language processing. The paper
  gives a brief overview of the history of NLP and the challenges which it has
  faced or has yet to overcome.
