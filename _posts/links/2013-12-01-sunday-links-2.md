- [Gneezy and Rustichini (2000)][1] examine the effect of imposing a fine on
  parents who arrive late to pick up their children from Israeli daycare
  centers. They find that parents actually arrive significantly later once this
  fine is in place. When what was formerly a fuzzy unwritten social contract is
  rewritten with an exact punishment, they suggest that parents feel free to
  break the rules and pay the exact fine (where before they were unsure about
  the potential consequences of their lateness).
- [Lawrence Lessig argues][2] that most of the people who watch The Social
  Network will miss the really important point in the story of the rise of
  Facebook: that is, no innovation of its kind would have been possible without
  the Internet, which is not bogged down by monopolies or excessive regulation
  (yet?).
- ["Bitcoin is Flawed, But It Will Still Take Over the World"][3] covers some of
  the most recent controversy concerning the booming cryptocurrency. It is still
  disputed whether the inevitable deflation of Bitcoin (the total circulation is
  limited by design) will doom the currency.<br/><br/>
  A [free rider problem][4] will also emerge when this limit is reached: those
  who currently "mine" Bitcoin are actually in effect working to validate real
  digital transactions. When there is no more coin to be mined, the incentive to
  continue supporting the network in this way drops significantly. There is by
  design a mechanism by which spenders can pay transaction fees to miners so
  that their exchanges are verified efficiently, but it is not certain that this
  will be a stable or sufficient incentive alone. The author ignores the
  possibility of the problem in suggesting: "They may run them just to keep the
  Bitcoin system going, knowing that the system will reward them in other ways."
- More on Bitcoin:
  ["As China Looms, the U.S. Ponders Ways Not to Destroy Bitcoin."][5] Robert
  McMillan of Wired Enterprise claims that current U.S. regulations are stifling
  an industry with great potential. He suggests that as the involvement of the
  Chinese with the currency skyrckets, a significant part of the Congressional
  support for Bitcoin is fueled by a worry of a China-dominated digital
  currency.
- In the early 20th century, William James' ["The Ph.D. Octopus"][6] pointed to
  a dangerous and popular trend of overdependence on credentials within
  academia. I can't say the problem has improved --- it's survived, rather, and
  spread into industry as well!
