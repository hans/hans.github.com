1. I like plants. Plants are nice. But are they conscious? Do they think?
   Follow this very beginner-friendly series on the Brains Blog:
   [Can plants remember?][1] [Perceive?][2] [Represent?][3] [Think?][4]
2. How is cognitive function distributed across the human brain? A meta-study
   [applies a simple entropy measure][5] over distributions of activations for
   brain regions across tasks. The findings: both cortical and subcortical
   regions vary greatly in their task diversity. An [assortativity][6] measure
   also varies greatly across cortex; some regions are functionally cohesive,
   while others seem to yield a patchwork of different functions.
