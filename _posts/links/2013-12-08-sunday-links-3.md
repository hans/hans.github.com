It's finals week here at Stanford. I'm just finishing up a research paper
entitled "*Imperat aut servit*: Managing our knowledge inheritance" which will
likely be published here after the quarter has ended. Apart from writing, I'm
beginning to think about further independent research. I've been investigating
patterns in Romanian etymology and am considering engaging in some sort of
formal analysis. Hayek is also still on my mind --- I've been wondering about
how I can model a particularly interesting statement in "The Use of Knowledge in
Society" using genetic programming. More on all of this later, I'm sure.

For now, here are the interesting parts of my (very sparse) reading this week:

- **[Hoxby (2009)][1]** details a trend of "re-sorting" among college applicants
  over the past decades which has led to a more efficient "matching" between
  high-aptitude students and high-selectivity schools. She demonstrates that
  per-student resources at highly selective universities have skyrocketed due to
  this higher efficiency: as better-matched students arrive at top-tier
  colleges, they demand the support they have been looking forward to.
  Furthermore, the paper reveals a curious trend in the financials of premier
  American colleges: the average student only pays around 20% of the value of
  the resources offered to him, while the remainder is repaid by alumni
  donations.
- **[*Growing Artificial Societies*][2]** by Epstein and Axtell has been useful
  as I think about developing a system to model problems in economics (see
  introduction).
