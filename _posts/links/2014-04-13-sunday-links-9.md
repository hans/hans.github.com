- Preliminary results from Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and
  Geography [indicate massive amounts of fraud][1] in the country's education
  system. I can't find credible English sources on this at the moment. See
  ["Censo en escuelas descubre anomal√≠as"][2] and a campaign to crack down on
  this fraud named ["Fin al abuso"][3].
- [*The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt*][6] details Roosevelt's growth from an
  awkward, squeaky boy obsessed with taxidermy and books into a man of
  staggering power and charisma. Inspiring read. Recommended to me by
  [Art of Manliness][7].
- ["The slumps that shaped modern finance"][5] covers the history of the
  financial industry from the late 18th century forward. Really fascinating
  read. (For those reading on a desktop, the web reading interface for this
  essay is also pretty nice!)
- An [interview with John McAfee][4].
