- [***Er ist wieder da* (Look Who's Back)**][3] is available on Netflix.
  It's based off a popular book in Germany by the same name. Adolf Hitler is
  plopped into a modern Berlin and becomes a comedy star as he reproduces his
  tirades on television shows. The country receives him as a talented
  impressionist who sometimes says things that sound sort of accurate.

  It's supposed to be a comedy. It's funny, sure, but it's also a very timely
  reminder in the current political climates of Europe and of the US. I'll
  translate two scenes below. These are translated from the subtitles; the
  actual spoken dialogue is much better.

  + Two colleagues (C) from a TV station bring home the Hitler "impostor," and
  they run into their German grandmother (G). The grandmother launches into a
  tirade: {::nomarkdown}<table><tr><td>G</td><td>Sie haben alle vergast!</td><td>You gassed
  everyone!</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>Oma, das ist Satire.</td><td>Grandma,
  it's just satire.</td></tr><tr><td>G</td><td>Er sieht aus wie
  früher.</td><td>He looks just like he used to.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Er
  sagt die gleichen Sachen wie früher.</td><td>He's saying the same things he
  used to.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Damals lachten die Leute anfangs
  auch.</td><td>Back then, people laughed at first, too.</td></tr></table>{:/}

  + The protagonist (P) has realized that the impostor Hitler is the real
  Hitler, and holds a pistol at Hitler's face.
{::nomarkdown}<table><tr><td>H</td><td>Haben Sie sich nie gefragt, warum die
Leute mir folgen?</td><td>Have you never asked yourself why people follow
me?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Weil sie im Kern genauso sind wie
ich.</td><td>Because they're at the core just like
me.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Sie teilen die gleichen Werte.</td><td>We have the
same values.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Darum schießen Sie auch
nicht.</td><td>That's why you won't shoot me.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"
style="text-align: center"><em>P shoots. Hitler collapses and vanishes, reappearing
behind P.</em></td></tr><tr><td>H</td><td>Sie können mich nicht
loswerden.</td><td>You can't get rid of me.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Ich bin
ein Teil von Ihnen.</td><td>I am a part of you.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Von
euch allen.</td><td>Of all of you.</td></tr></table>{:/}

  Worth a watch.
- Tom Vanderbilt tells his story of discovering cycling in [**The Long and
  Winding Road**][2]. He recounts his humble road-biker beginnings, and
  accurately describes the pain and glory on the way to a life of serious
  pedaling. It's a nice tribute to the crazy, maybe-masochistic sport I've come
  to love. The long article ends with a brief tour from San Francisco to Santa
  Barbara.
- An introduction to the [**work of composer Dmitri Shostakovich**][1].
