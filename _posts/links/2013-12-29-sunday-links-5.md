- I have just discovered (via [Ben Kuhn][2]) a wonderful blog called
  [Ribbonfarm][3]. While I'm still struggling to understand what the site is
  really about,[^1] I feel obligated to share an outstanding summary of the book
  [*Seeing Like a State*][5] in the post
  [**"A Big Little Idea Called Legibility"**][4]. Ribbonfarm's author presents
  the "authoritarian high-modernist recipe for failure," a detail of the process
  by which leaders throughout history have consistently attempted at utopian
  reform for the better and failed miserably. [*Seeing Like a State*][5] went
  onto my reading list immediately after I finished this article.
- [***The Three Languages of Politics***][8] presents a "three-axis model" which
  is claimed to chain modern political discourse, restricting the various
  political "tribes" (in this model, progressives, conservatives, and
  libertarians) from having real constructive debates. Actively detach yourself
  from the axis on which your [System 1][9] lounges, he suggests, and you'll be
  able to better understand the arguments of those who oppose you (and avoid
  engaging in the self-reinforcing rhetoric of the tribe you might associate
  with for any given issue).
- Economist Bryan Caplan suggests we give those pushing a certain policy or
  perspective an [**"ideological Turing test"**][6]. Here's the test: Take a
  person of ideology A and place him in a room of people who strongly support
  ideology B. If the person can't convincingly argue for ideology B and blend
  in, the person fails the test. Those who fail this kind of test make it
  evident that they chose to simply argue for a side rather than examining all
  possible lines of reasoning.
- [**"Lunch with the FT: Peter Thiel"**][7] gives a brief peek inside Thiel's
  mind.
- The Economist gives a really great overview of the Sapir-Whorf debate in
  [**"Do different languages confer different personalities?"**][1]. I'll
  definitely refer people to this article when the Whorfian question comes up in
  future discussions.

[^1]: The site's tagline, "experiments in refactored perception," doesn't help me too much.
