- Lots of reading for an NLP-themed week
  ([Stanford Workshop on AI and Knowledge][6] was on Wednesday, and preparation
  for a big NLU project is ramping up). I've been reading much of
  [**Magnus Sahlgren's work**][7] on distributed word representations. Also
  worth mentioning: [**Huang, Socher, Manning and Ng (2012)**][8] learn word
  embeddings using both local and global context;
  [**Reisinger and Mooney (2010)**][9] show how VSMs can handle polysemy.
- [**"Shut up and deal"**][4]: Tesla is restricted from selling in New Jersey
  due to a statute which requires manufacturers to sell through dealers.
- [**"The Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio is your new bicycle."**][1]
  Leverage ratio requirements are being increased for some of the US's
  systematically important financial institutions. See [Fed press release][2],
  [Reuters coverage][3].
- [**"The recovery puzzle."**][5]
