## Contact

Thanks for reaching out! Before you send an email, please consider my inbox:

I'm happy to reply to:

- Questions/issues/ideas regarding my papers, blog posts, published code, etc.
- Questions about research, career planning, etc.
  <br/>I'm especially interested in meeting ambitious young undergraduates
  looking to getting involved in ML/NLP research. If you fit this category,
  please go ahead and send an email!
  <br/>(I hear from quite a lot of people in this category, and may be slow to
  reply --- but I'll do my best.)

I **do not reply** to:

- Recruiting emails
- Requests to refer you to any of my past employers
- Requests to help debug your code

With that said, please **[get in touch](mailto:jon@gauthiers.net)**!
